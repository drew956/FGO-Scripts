# FGO-Scripts
A collection of javascript bookmarklets and other things for quickly finding FGO information on a given page.

Currently created bookmarklets:
<ul>
  <li> (DEPRECATED: The site has a navigation bar... this is completely unnecessary) Quick Servant Skill Check
    <ul>
      <li>For use on grandorder.gamepress.gg</li>
      <li>Quickly look up the stats for a servant's current skill levels</li>
      <li>Saves you like... 10 seconds or so of scrolling and clicking.</li>
      <li>Convenient if you are only interested in looking at one level of each skill at a time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

The quick servant skill check bookmarklet is designed to allow you to quickly look up the current buffs/stats of a servant's skills. 
For example, "Oh, my Gramps has his Bell EX at level 3... what does that do again?"
You navigate to their page in gamepress, 
https://grandorder.gamepress.gg/servant/first-hassan
and then click the bookmarklet to run the script. 
Then choose the levels for each skill and it will pull out the data for you, so you don't have to scroll and click anything to reveal the table.
It is a WIP, however, and future features/changes to how it looks will be made.
