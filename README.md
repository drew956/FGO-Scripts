# FGO-Scripts
A collection of javascript bookmarklets and other things for quickly finding FGO information on a given page.

Currently created bookmarklets:
<ul>
  <li>Quick Servant Skill Check Tool
    <ul>
      Pros:
      <li>For use on grandorder.gamepress.gg</li>
      <li>Quickly look up the stats for a servant's current skill levels</li>
      <li>Saves you like... 5+ seconds or so of scrolling and clicking.</li>
      <li>Convenient if you are only interested in looking at one level of each skill at a time.</li>
      Cons:
      <li>It is inserted at the top of the page</li>
      <li>It only shows you the values for the skill at that level, so not good for planning ahead</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Advertisement Video Closer
    <ul>
      <li>For use on gamepress.gg</li>
      <li>Click to close the ad video that pops up</li>
      <li>Might be useful on mobile phones where the X is harder to click</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

The quick servant skill check bookmarklet is designed to allow you to quickly look up the current buffs/stats of a servant's skills. 
For example, "Oh, my Gramps has his Bell EX at level 3... what does that do again?"
You navigate to their page in gamepress, 
https://grandorder.gamepress.gg/servant/first-hassan
and then click the bookmarklet to run the script. 
Then choose the levels for each skill and it will pull out the data for you, so you don't have to scroll and click anything to reveal the table.
It is a WIP, however, and future features/changes to how it looks will be made.
